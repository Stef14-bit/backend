# Grocery Delivery App Backend Readme

Hello and welcome to the readme file for the backend of the Grocery Delivery App!
This application is currently in progress and is designed to provide a seamless experience for
customers looking to order groceries online.

## Technologies Used

To build this application, I utilized several technologies and packages. Here is a list of the packages I used, along with a brief description of each:

- ### argon2:

A library used for password hashing, which helps to protect user data.

- ### - dotenv:

A package used to load environment variables from a .env file, which allows us to store sensitive data securely.

- ### express:

A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js that allows us to build powerful APIs easily.

- ### express-validator:

A middleware used to validate incoming request data, ensuring that the data we receive is valid and secure.

- ### mysql2:

A MySQL client for Node.js that allows us to communicate with our SQL database.

## Database

I chose to use SQL as my database for this project. SQL is a powerful and flexible database management system that allows to store, retrieve, and manipulate data quickly and easily. The database stores information about customers, their orders, and the groceries they have purchased.

### Work in Progress

Please note that this application is currently a work in progress.I am continually making improvements and adding new features to provide customers with the best possible experience. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out .

Thank you for choosing Grocery Delivery App!
